This repository also includes a program to test your code. Be sure your class names and file names match otherwise the tester will not be able to find your programs.
If your output does not match the expected output text files exactly, the tests will fail. 
However, determining why these tests fail can be very tricky because of the whitespace involved. Leave a message in this README if you are 
unable to get the program to pass the tester but the output looks virtually identical. Do **NOT** spend ages trying to debug the output for whitespace.

You may alter the expected output if your code does something different, like alterantive lyrics to the twelve days. 

Be sure to document your source code and update this README. Please contact me if you need assistance.
